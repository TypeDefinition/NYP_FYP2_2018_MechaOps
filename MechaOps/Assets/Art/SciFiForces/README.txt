SciFi Forces

Some prefabs have a turret. If you assign the target 
variable of the SciFiTurret component, the turret will 
aim at that target.

The SciFiArtillery component has an angle variable 
which raises and lowers the gun.

Prefabs that have wheels are animated using the 
WheelAnimator component. Set the speed variable to spin
the wheels. Set the steer angle variable to steer the
vehicle. Some vehicles have 4 wheel steering, in which
case the rear wheels turn opposite to the front.

Prefabs that use tracks are animated using the 
TrackAnimator component. Set the speed variable to roll
the tracks.
